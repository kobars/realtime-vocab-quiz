# Real-time vocabulary quiz

A real-time quiz service: players join a quiz session by its ID, answer timed
vocabulary questions, and watch a shared leaderboard update live as scores
change. The server is Python (FastAPI over WebSockets, Redis for scores and
fan-out); the client is a Vue 3 single-page app.

Status: work in progress.
